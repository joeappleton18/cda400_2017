##TCA pre written paragraph preparation

You will need to prepare 2-3 paragraphs of discussion on the below topics. These will be submitted as part of the TCA and will make up **5%** of your mark.  You must be able to access these answers on the day of the TCA as they will act as placeholder text for your website. 

- **What is HTML?**

- **Data protection considerations when asking users to fill out web forms**  

- **On page SEO considerations**

 Important, please write no more than2-3 paragraphs on each topic, we don’t require citations. It may also be useful to wrap the text in <p> tags to make it easy to insert into your website on the day of the TCA.
