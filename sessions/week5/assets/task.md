#Session 6 Semantic HTML Task

##Task 1 - Using Semantic HTML

The purpose of this task is to use semantic HTML elements and also gain a greater understanding of using floats to lay out a HTML page. 


**Set up**

* Inside your `internet_tech` directory create a `session6` folder 
* Within the `session6` directory create a `css` folder and within it make a file called `main.css`
* Within the `session6` folder create an html file called `index.html` and `<link>` your style sheet into the page

You now should update your html and css files so your resulting page resembles the below image:

You should approach this task in the following way and also use the session 6  example on myCourse to help you.

**HTML**

* As a starting point create the  `<div id="wrapper"> ... </div>`.  This division will contain the content for the whole page
* Split `index.html` into the sections represented in the above diagram. **Note** you should be using semantic HTML5 tags
* Populate your site with some content, you can use place holder text if you like
* Remember to use a `<ul>` to hold the navigation links


**CSS**

* Now style your site so the layout resembles the above diagram
* Give all of the sections different colours so you can identify them  
* You'll need to adjust the width of each section to achieve the above layout 
* You should also set the `list-style: none` property on the `ul`
* Remember, as were using semantic HTML5, most the selectors can be styled directly, for example:

		header {
		
				 color: white;
   				 background-color: black;
   				 text-align: center;
		}

##Task 3 CSS3

* Apply a ` background: linear-gradient;`  to your `wrapper` div.
* Apply a `border` and a `radius` to one of your sections. 


##Task 4 More CSS3 (Optional)

You should have already used the CSS3 properties `border` and `radius` at this point. This task requires you to implement at least 2 further CSS3 properties into your page

You'll need to:

* Learn about the different types of CSS3 rules [Here is a great resource](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/10-css3-properties-you-need-to-be-familiar-with--net-16417).
* Pick out some properties that interest you
* Implement them into your webpage 


##Task 5 Validate Your HTML Code
Ensure your HTML code is valid using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
