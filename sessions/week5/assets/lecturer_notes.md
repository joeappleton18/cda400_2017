#Session 6 

It's of course down to you how you deliver the lectures. Today I created the demos from scratch and got the students to work along with me. I wanted to show them how I work, along the way I highlighted things like code indentation and how I move between CSS and HTML.

###05-15 mins - Navigation DEMO1 (slide 2)

A great opportunity to introduce CSS descendant selectors at the same time as navigation bars.  

**Key points**

* 95% of navigations bars are constructed using `<ul>` elements
* They are really handy for grouping together elements 
* We normally need to apply some styles to make them look good
* Use the html descendant selector to target child  elements e.g.
          
           .nav a {
				text-decoration: none;
			} 
			
			
* The above method of styling can be used to target children of any block level HTML elements
 

###10-25 mins -  Gradients, Radius and css3 DEMO2 (slide 3)

CSS3 is the latest incarnation of styles. Today we're just going to be looking at `gradients ` and `radius`. Please do however make the students aware of some other `CSS3` properties that can be used.

* Students will need to use `gradients` and `radius` in assessment 1. 
* Don't worry about the different webkits for now. 



###25 - 30 mins HTML5 Semantic Elements (slide 4, 5 and 6)

I was going to go into more depth here, but they know the concept of block level sections. So you'll just need to cover the below key points:
		
* Semantic HTML elements are a more descriptive alternative to div's.   
  <sub>Students can use divs or a mixture of divs and spans for the     assessments</sub>
*  It makes  HTML far more readable, no more div soup
*  By styling elements directly, we can cut back on using `id` and `class` attributes so much.


###30 mins + Task 
The HTML file has been defined for them this week. The students primarily need to focus on the CSS.
