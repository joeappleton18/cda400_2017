#Internet Technology Week 2 Practical

 
##1. Create your timetable

Create a new file called `timetable.html` and save it in the folder
`session2` on your [cloud9](https://c9.io/) instance. Recreate your timetable using the table tags and attributes discussed in todays the lesson. It should resemble the example below:

![time table](assets/timetable.png)

Remember, you can use `<br>` or `<p>` tags to create new lines. You can also wrap text in the `<strong>..</strong>` tags to create a bold effect. It's fine to use these tags within a `<td>`, `<th>` table cell.  

##2. Validate your work so far
Use the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure all your work so far is valid.
