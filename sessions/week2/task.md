#Internet Technology Week 2 Practical

 
##1. Create your timetable

Create a new file called `timetable.html` and save it in the folder
`session2` within your `U` drive internet tech folder. Recreate your timetable using the table tags and attributes discussed in todays the lesson. It should resemble the example below:

![time table](assets/timetable.png)

Remember, you can use `<br>` or `<p>` tags to create new lines. You can also wrap text in the `<strong>..</strong>` tags to create a bold effect. It's fine to use these tags within a `<td>`, `<th>` table cell.  

##2. Validate your work so far
Use the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure all your work so far is valid. 


##3. Advanced optional task 

**This task uses the power of HTML5 video and GitHub**


**Note**, I don't provide information in the notes on how to do this. You need to read around the task items in order to complete this task:

- Install git on your computer  [git download](https://git-scm.com/)
- Sign up to [GitHub](www.github.com)
- Work out how to create a [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)

- Within the gitHub pages directory on your local computer create a index.html file 
- Work out how to download save and include [this](https://github.com/joeappleton18/joeappleton18.github.io/blob/master/scripts/main.js) script into index.html. You should try and include it as a external javascript file 

- If you've included the script properly, every time you include the tag below into your index.html file, you'll see a 200*200px streaming video from you webcam:  

   ```html <video class="video" width="200" height="200" autoplay>```
 

- Using a table create a webcam mosaic like mine below:

- Publish your work to gitHub pages
- Email me the link (joe.appleton@solent.ac.uk). 
- Pat yourself of the back, you're well ahead of the curve
