#Weekly Task - Laying out Forms
The purpose of this task is to increase your understanding of how to layout forms. 

#1 Setup

- Create the file `form_task.html` and store it in a safe place on your u drive. Copy the starting HTML source code from here `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirus21/Internet_technology/master/session8/practicals/session_8_main_task.html`and past it into `form_task.html`.

- Include create an external css file and `<link>` it to `form_task.html`



#2 Lay out the form

As you can see, currently no consideration has been given to the layout of the form. Using the techniques we covered in the lecture, your task is to lay the form out. As a minimum you should:

* Use `<p>` tags to divide inputs and labels into related lines
* Use `fieldset` and `legend` to group together common inputs
* Ensure inputs and labels are aligned correctly
* Style the submit button

#3 HTM5 validation
Apply an HTML5 validation to your form and use the `:invalid` or `:valid`  pseudo class so users know if their input is valid.  

#4 Validate your HTML
Make sure your HTML is valid.


#5 Optional (Advanced Tasks)
