#Session 3 Notes 

##Learning Outcomes 

###Elements 
Difference between inline elements and block level elements
`div` and `span` tag

###Attributes 
`class` `id`

###CSS
`text-align` `border-<side>` , `background-color` , `font-family` , `font-size`, `margin`

###Development and workflow
brackets.io  can now be demoed as it's on the `I:` drive. 



##Important Points
After the initial lecture/intro cant check each students learning log is an HTML page and up to date.    
		**The URL's must be relative, also `\` paths won't work once on the server**   
		**There should be no space in the file paths**
		
Please be really strict with the register, it looks like the course access system is working now, so just use that. 


##Lesson plan 


####0-5 mins 
Demo brackets (it's now installed on the i drive), show the students the live preview window. Also, I'm going to use it for my in-class demos.

####5-10 mins (slide number 2,3)
Press the fact that they need to be getting on with the assessment. Use slide 3 to give a visual representation of what the deliverables should look like. 


###10-15 mins (slide number 5) and use DEMO1...html
Demo the difference between inline and block elements.  Also, stress that students should use this template to create their own skeleton file. 



###20-25 mins slide (slide number 6, 7, 8) and use DEMO2
<sub> Demo 2 is styled just look at the html structure at this point </sub>

Intro the `id` and `class`attribute. `id` must be unique `class` can be used to many times. Also talk about the concept of `div` and `span` tags. We also  wrap the content in a `div` with an id of `wrapper` or `content`.  We must use comments and indentation to indicate which div we're closing, things can get messy.

**`class` and `id` names are a free choice**, but make them meaningful.


###25-35/40 mins Introduce CSS use DEMO2 

Three types of styling option, **inline, internal, external**, we prefer external. Must place the link in the head, this link is included in the html5 session 2 template    
     `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">`
 **Key Points**   
 - We can style HTML tags/selectors directly for the whole document `h : {... }`  
 - Remember body is where everything visible is shown, so we can set things like the text for the whole     document    
 - We can group common element that share the same styles `table,th,td:{border: 1px dotted #000000` 
 - How to style classes and ids    
 - **Optional** ` margin: 0 auto;` shorthand, I'm just going to say it's for centre aligning a div 

###30 Mins kick off task for the week
**Check that everyone is up to speed with their learning log - last week's task, check with each individual and check their code and structure**   
**Make sure people have duplicated week2's task and placed it in a session folder**
