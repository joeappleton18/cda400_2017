In this case we can change the display property to block\nFor example, here's how we centre align an image:\n  .displayed {\n       display: block; \n       margin-left: auto; \n       margin-right: auto;\n   }\n\n\nWe can then assign the display class to an image:\n  \n\n\nWe can also use the shorthand margin property to achieve the same result:\n  img.displayed \n  {  \n         display: block;\n         margin: 0 auto;  \n  }\n\n\n\nMargins\n\nMargin values can be specified either on all sides or on individual sides\n\nsingle value for each margin: top, left, bottom and right, e.g. margin:10px;\n\ntwo values: 1st=top & bottom; 2nd=left & right, e.g. margin:10px 5px;\n\nfour values: top, right, bottom and left, e.g. margin:10px 5px 15px 20px;\n\n\nWidth and Height\n\nThe width and height properties can be specified using percentage or length values (e.g. pixels or %)\n\nSpecifying widths of elements in % means they will will shrink or grow so they are always in scale with the screen size  \n   p {width: 40%;}\n\n\n\nPosition Property\n    selector {\n        position: \n    }\n\nstatic – default value  i.e. elements are laid out in the normal flow\n\nrelative – an element is moved relative to its place in the normal flow according to its top and left values\n\nabsolute – an element is taken completely out of the flow and then positioned with respect to the top and left of the first element that contains it. Used for sticky footers, try to avoid in any other case. \n\nfixed – an element remains exactly where it is when the page is scrolled\n\n\nDefault static position of 2 DIVS\n\n#wrapper{\nwidth: 80%\n}\n#box1 {\n     width: 20%;\n}\n#box2 {   \n   width: 20%;   \n}\nAdding a float left\n#wrapper{\nwidth: 80%\n}\n#box1 {\n     width: 20%;\n  float: left;\n}\n#box2 {   \n   width: 20%; \n   float: left;   \n}\n\nAdding a float to the left and right\n#wrapper{\nwidth: 80%\n}\n#box1 {\n     width: 20%;\n  float: left;\n}\n#box2 {   \n   width: 20%; \n   float: right;   \n}\n\n"},"sessions/week4/task.html":{"url":"sessions/week4/task.html","title":"Practical","keywords":"","body":"Session 4 Tasks\nPlease only use external styles for this task. \nTask 1  - Style up your week one page\nSet up  \n\nInside your internet_tech directory create a session4 folder. \nCopy your webpage from session1 into the session4 folder you just created. \nCreate a new style sheet and  it into your webpage. It's a good idea to place the style sheet in a new folder e.g. css. \n\nLet's make your page look a little but more presentable\nPlease go wild and style the page as much as you like, but as a minimum I want to see you complete the below tasks. Once done your page should resemble the layout below:\n\n\nSection up your site using a minimum of 3 's#left_nav,#sectionand#wrapper` which holds all the content.\nTo start with give #left_nav a width of 20% and #section a width of 80%.\nGive #wrapper a width of 80% and centre align it using #wrapper {margin: 0 auto;} \nAdd a different background-color to  #left_nav and #section.\nUse float to position  #left_nav and #section side by side, as per the mock up above. \nUse a ... to create a basic navigation list in #left_nav. Have at least 3 links, but you don't need to create the corresponding pages. Here's how to create a placeholder link:   Home \nApply some pseudo classes to your links, so they change colour based on their status.
