We can use the dependent selectors to style small page elements (molecules/atems)\nThe descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of given element\nWe can use it to avoid the over use of id’s and class attributes\nIt therefore lends itself very well to modular/atomic design \n\ncss\n#contact_section  {\n     font-color: grey;\n}\n\n#contact_section p{\n      font-size: 10px        \n}\n\n#contact_section h1 {\n  font-size: 27px\n}\n\nhtml\n\n\n     Grey font size 27px \n\n   This will be grey and font size 10 px\n     I’ll also be grey and font size 10 px \n\n \n\n\nIn the above example, notice how we can use the #contact_section selector by itself to set defaults. In this case we've set the font colour to grey\n\nLists For Navigation Bar’s\n\nList are a great way to group common elements, therefor they are the go to when it comes to implementing menus in HTML. \n\nWe can use the HTML descendant selector to target child elements of our \n\n\n\nhtml\n\n            \n                 Home \n                 Contact \n                 About \n            \n \n\ncss\n#header ul li {\n\n    list-style: none; /** removes bullet points 8*/\n    display: inline; /*flattens the list **/\n    margin-left: 10px;  /** spaces out the menu **/\n}\nHTML5 Semantic Elements\n\nHTML5 gives us the option to use HTML elements that are more expressive.

Instead of using  we can use the  tagHTML5 Semantic Elements Examples\n\n\n\n\n: defines a header for a document or a section\n - defines a container for navigation links\n - defines a section in a document\n - defines an independent self-contained article\n - defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)\n - defines a footer for a document or a section\n\n\n\nExample of a HTML 5 Layout\n\n   \n    \n          Header\n    \n    \n         \n             This is your left navigation … \n         \n    \n    \n          Subheading\n           This is the content part … \n    \n    \n            Footer \n    \n \n\n\nCSS3 Gradient And Radius\n\nCSS3 is the latest version of CSS\nIt goes hand in hand with HTML5\nThere are many new exciting features\nFor example, it's now easy to apply effects to our html elements \nLook how easy it is to create an interesting effect on the below , by using the radius and gradient property. \n\n\n.box1{\n    width: 100px;    \n    height: 100px;    \n    border: 2px solid black;    \n    border-radius: 10px;    \n    background:   linear-gradient(red, blue);\n}\n\nCan I Use It\n\nOlder browsers may not support the latest CSS features \nIt's important you know which browsers you need to be supported\nYou can check for browser support using http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-gradients\n\n\n\n\nhttp://caniuse.com/ support for css3\n\n\n"},"sessions/week5/practical.html":{"url":"sessions/week5/practical.html","title":"Practical","keywords":"","body":"Session 5 Semantic HTML Task\nTask 1 - Using Semantic HTML\nThe purpose of this task is to understand semantic HTML elements and also gain a greater understanding of using floats to lay out a HTML page. \nSet up\n\nDownload the task from here\nExtract it inside your internet_tech folder\nThe resulting folder will be called session6\nOpen index.html within your favourite text editor and make sure you understand how the semantic HTML elements are laid out\nIt should currently look like the below image in your browser:   \n\n \n\nOpen up the css/main.css file and follow the steps in /* .. */ comments\nThese steps will guide you through the style sheet implementation.

This week we'll focus on how to style and lay out form controls.  \nLaying out forms\nForms are probably one of the more complex structures that you'll encounter in HTML. Therefore, making them layout correctly can prove somewhat tricky. \nIt's important that we design usable and accessible forms:\n\nMore people will be able to fill out your forms\nYou'll get more customers and make more money\nAccessible forms lead to a better overall user experience\nWell coded forms can easily utilise analytics packages such as Google Analytics\n\nConsider the below form (source code here. As you can see by default it's completely unusable. \n\nIn the next few pages we're going to go through a typical design process that would be used to layout a form.  \n1) The  and  elements\n\nThe  ..  tag is used to group common form elements together\n        \n           First Name     \n           Last Name     \n        \n\nBy default,  ..  is a block level element and has a border, you should know how to change this using CSS\n\n  \n         First Name     \n         Last Name     \n \n\n\nWe can use the  ..  element to add a title to our    \n\n  \n     Name \n         First Name:     \n         Last Name:     \n\n\n  \n Name \n     First Name:     \n     Last Name:     \n\n\n2)  tags can be used to create separate lines\nInput elements and labels are inline, therefore we need to wrap them in a block level elements so they sit on their own line. The W3C recommend to wrap form elements in  tags in order create new lines. \n \n     Name \n     First Name:   \n    Last Name:   \n  \n\n\n  \n          Name \n         First Name:   \n        Last Name:   \n\n\nBasic CSS For Forms\n\nConsider the following un-styled form  \n\n\n      \n    \n        First Name\n         First Name   \n         Credit Card Information   \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\nJust like with HTML, we can take pragmatic steps to lay the form out \n\n1) Give the form an ID\n\nIn order to style this form we need to give the form and id \nWe can now style this specific form using decent selectors e.g. #payment legend {text-align: centre;}\n\n\n\n2) Constrain the width of the form\n\nCurrently the form is too wide, let's give it a width:500px. Remember the  has an id attribute. We can use this to add styles\n\n3) Align the inputs\n\nTo solve this problem we need to float the text inputs to the right. The problem is we can't just say #payment input {float:right} because our button is also a input and we don't want to style this yet. We need to just target  in order to do this we can use the following CSS declaration:\n  #payment input[type=\"text\"] {\n       float: right;\n  }\n\nYou can change the input[type=\"\"] to whatever type of input you want to target\n\nOur text inputs are now aligned \n\n\n\nFurther Styling Of Inputs\n\nYou can change the can border colour and width of text inputs by implementing the border property \n\n#payment input[type=\"text\"] {\n        border: 1px solid green;    \n}\n``\n\n* We can style our input button just like any other HTML element. Remember, we can change the text on the button from submit to anything we like by implementing the attribute `value`  e.g.  ``. \n\n```html                 \n#payment input[type=\"submit\"]  {\n        border-radius: 4px; \n        border: solid 1px black; \n        font-size:20px;\n\n\n}\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nLaying OutStyling Check And Radio Boxes\n\nWe can use  and  optional   to group together our related 's \nJust like with any other input we can use  tags to create a new line\n\n\n Transport \nI have a bike\nI have a car \n\n\n\n\n     Transport \n    I have a bike\n    I have a car \n    \n\n\nStyling Valid Invalid Inputs\nRemember in the last session, we looked at just how easy it is to validate forms using html5:\n \nYou can specifically target valid and invalid form fields using the pseudo selector :valid and :invalid :\ninput:invalid {\n    border: solid red;\n}\n\ninput:valid {\n    border:solid green;\n}\n\nIf you only want to display validation formatting when the form field is in focus     (someone has clicked on it), we can use the focus: selector along with :invalid or :valid :\n\ninput:focus:valid { \n          border:solid green;\n }\n\n"}}}
