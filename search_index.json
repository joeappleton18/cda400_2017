In this case we can change the display property to block\nFor example, here's how we centre align an image:\n  .displayed {\n       display: block; \n       margin-left: auto; \n       margin-right: auto;\n   }\n\n\nWe can then assign the display class to an image:\n  \n\n\nWe can also use the shorthand margin property to achieve the same result:\n  img.displayed \n  {  \n         display: block;\n         margin: 0 auto;  \n  }\n\n\n\nMargins\n\nMargin values can be specified either on all sides or on individual sides\n\nsingle value for each margin: top, left, bottom and right, e.g. margin:10px;\n\ntwo values: 1st=top & bottom; 2nd=left & right, e.g. margin:10px 5px;\n\nfour values: top, right, bottom and left, e.g. margin:10px 5px 15px 20px;\n\n\nWidth and Height\n\nThe width and height properties can be specified using percentage or length values (e.g. pixels or %)\n\nSpecifying widths of elements in % means they will will shrink or grow so they are always in scale with the screen size  \n   p {width: 40%;}\n\n\n\nPosition Property\n    selector {\n        position: \n    }\n\nstatic – default value  i.e. elements are laid out in the normal flow\n\nrelative – an element is moved relative to its place in the normal flow according to its top and left values\n\nabsolute – an element is taken completely out of the flow and then positioned with respect to the top and left of the first element that contains it. Used for sticky footers, try to avoid in any other case. \n\nfixed – an element remains exactly where it is when the page is scrolled\n\n\nDefault static position of 2 DIVS\n\n#wrapper{\nwidth: 80%\n}\n#box1 {\n     width: 20%;\n}\n#box2 {   \n   width: 20%;   \n}\nAdding a float left\n#wrapper{\nwidth: 80%\n}\n#box1 {\n     width: 20%;\n  float: left;\n}\n#box2 {   \n   width: 20%; \n   float: left;   \n}\n\nAdding a float to the left and right\n#wrapper{\nwidth: 80%\n}\n#box1 {\n     width: 20%;\n  float: left;\n}\n#box2 {   \n   width: 20%; \n   float: right;   \n}\n\n"},"sessions/week4/task.html":{"url":"sessions/week4/task.html","title":"Practical","keywords":"","body":"Session 4 Tasks\nPlease only use external styles for this task. \nTask 1  - Style up your week one page\nSet up  \n\nInside your internet_tech directory create a session4 folder. \nCopy your webpage from session1 into the session4 folder you just created. \nCreate a new style sheet and  it into your webpage.

This week we'll focus on how to style and lay out form controls.  \nLaying out forms\nForms are probably one of the more complex structures that you'll encounter in HTML. Therefore, making them layout correctly can prove somewhat tricky. \nIt's important that we design usable and accessible forms:\n\nMore people will be able to fill out your forms\nYou'll get more customers and make more money\nAccessible forms lead to a better overall user experience\nWell coded forms can easily utilise analytics packages such as Google Analytics\n\nConsider the below form (source code here. As you can see by default it's completely unusable. \n\nIn the next few pages we're going to go through a typical design process that would be used to layout a form.  \n1) The  and  elements\n\nThe  ..  tag is used to group common form elements together\n        \n           First Name     \n           Last Name     \n        \n\nBy default,  ..  is a block level element and has a border, you should know how to change this using CSS\n\n  \n         First Name     \n         Last Name     \n \n\n\nWe can use the  ..  element to add a title to our    \n\n  \n     Name \n         First Name:     \n         Last Name:     \n\n\n  \n Name \n     First Name:     \n     Last Name:     \n\n\n2)  tags can be used to create separate lines\nInput elements and labels are inline, therefore we need to wrap them in a block level elements so they sit on their own line. The W3C recommend to wrap form elements in  tags in order create new lines. \n \n     Name \n     First Name:   \n    Last Name:   \n  \n\n\n  \n          Name \n         First Name:   \n        Last Name:   \n\n\nBasic CSS For Forms\n\nConsider the following un-styled form  \n\n\n      \n    \n        First Name\n         First Name   \n         Credit Card Information   \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\nJust like with HTML, we can take pragmatic steps to lay the form out \n\n1) Give the form an ID\n\nIn order to style this form we need to give the form and id \nWe can now style this specific form using decent selectors e.g. #payment legend {text-align: centre;}\n\n\n\n2) Constrain the width of the form\n\nCurrently the form is too wide, let's give it a width:500px. Remember the  has an id attribute. We can use this to add styles\n\n3) Align the inputs\n\nTo solve this problem we need to float the text inputs to the right. The problem is we can't just say #payment input {float:right} because our button is also a input and we don't want to style this yet. We need to just target  in order to do this we can use the following CSS declaration:\n  #payment input[type=\"text\"] {\n       float: right;\n  }\n\nYou can change the input[type=\"\"] to whatever type of input you want to target\n\nOur text inputs are now aligned \n\n\n\nFurther Styling Of Inputs\n\nYou can change the can border colour and width of text inputs by implementing the border property \n\n#payment input[type=\"text\"] {\n        border: 1px solid green;    \n}\n``\n\n* We can style our input button just like any other HTML element. Remember, we can change the text on the button from submit to anything we like by implementing the attribute `value`  e.g.  ``. \n\n```html                 \n#payment input[type=\"submit\"]  {\n        border-radius: 4px; \n        border: solid 1px black; \n        font-size:20px;\n\n\n}\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nLaying OutStyling Check And Radio Boxes\n\nWe can use  and  optional   to group together our related 's \nJust like with any other input we can use  tags to create a new line\n\n\n Transport \nI have a bike\nI have a car \n\n\n\n\n     Transport \n    I have a bike\n    I have a car \n    \n\n\nStyling Valid Invalid Inputs\nRemember in the last session, we looked at just how easy it is to validate forms using html5:\n \nYou can specifically target valid and invalid form fields using the pseudo selector :valid and :invalid :\ninput:invalid {\n    border: solid red;\n}\n\ninput:valid {\n    border:solid green;\n}\n\nIf you only want to display validation formatting when the form field is in focus     (someone has clicked on it), we can use the focus: selector along with :invalid or :valid :\n\ninput:focus:valid { \n          border:solid green;\n }\n\n"},"sessions/week9/task.html":{"url":"sessions/week9/task.html","title":"Practical","keywords":"","body":"Weekly Task - Laying out Forms\nThe purpose of this task is to increase your understanding of how to layout forms. \n1 Setup\n\nCreate the file form_task.html and store it in a safe place on your u drive.
