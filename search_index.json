Remember this is a style sheet not a HTML document. \nNow we need to link to the style sheet from our timetable HTML page. This is done for you if you've used the HTML5 template from session 2. If not,  you'll need to enter the following in the ... section of your page: \n\n1.1 Section up your page using  , , id , class tags and attributes\nBelow is how my timetable HTML looks. (This is only the ... section, not the entire document)    \nObserve how all of the content is wrapped in a  ...  this is good practice, so don't miss this out.   \nAlso, mark the closing  tags  with a comment e.g. .

Furthermore, as this style sheet is external we can create new HTML pages with the same look and feel by just including this style sheet!\nHave a look at the appendix to see what my styles look like to control the look and feel of my HTML\nPlease get as creative as you like, but as a minimum I'd like to see:\n\nA font-family set up for the body (this will set the font for your whole page) \nAlign h1 centre, use text-align\nChange the colour of some of your table cells use background-color\nStyle multiple elements with one rule set, your table is a good way to show this off \n table,th,td  {         \n  border: 1px dashed grey;   \n margin: 0px auto;    \n }\nApply styles using both classes and id's, remember id's are for unique elements on the page like #footer.\n\nOptional - Have a play and see if you can work out how I aligned elements such as the table and the wrapper div in the middle of the page   \n3 Validate your HTML\nMake sure your HTML is valid using the W3C validator. https://validator.w3.org/\n4 Appendix\n\n"}}}
